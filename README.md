# GA Resources

A curated list of geometric algebra resources, inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists.

### Introductions to GA

- [Imaginary Numbers Are Not Real](http://geometry.mrao.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ImagNumbersArentReal.pdf) by **Stephen Gull**, **Anthony Lasenby**, and **Chris Doran**

## Contribution

The goal is to eventually use a peer curation process for maintaining this repo once a sufficient number of people are participating in the organization. Until then, just submit pull requests or open an issue.
